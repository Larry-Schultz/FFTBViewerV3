# Twitch Chat Reader - Java Application

## Overview

A modern Spring Boot-powered Twitch chat reader application that monitors real-time chat messages from specific Twitch channels. Features both console output and a web interface with WebSocket support to display the last 50 chat messages in real-time. Built with Maven and designed for robust, authenticated Twitch integration with the 'fftbattleground' channel.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- Java 11 (OpenJDK)

- `ChatMessageService.java` - Service managing the last 50 chat messages
- `WebSocketConfig.java` - WebSocket configuration for real-time communication
- `WebController.java` - Web controller serving the chat viewer interface
- `application.properties` - Spring Boot configuration file

**Features:**
- Real-time chat message display with timestamps (console + web)

## Data Flow

1. Spring Boot application starts and loads configuration from `application.properties` and environment variables
2. Creates OAuth2 credential (anonymous if no token provided)
3. Initializes Twitch client and registers event handlers
4. Connects to specified Twitch channel
5. Listens for chat events and displays formatted messages
6. Monitors connection health and auto-reconnects if needed
7. User can quit gracefully with 'q' command
