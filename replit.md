# Twitch Chat Reader - Java Application

## Overview

A modern Spring Boot-powered Twitch chat reader application that monitors real-time chat messages from specific Twitch channels. Features both console output and a web interface with WebSocket support to display the last 50 chat messages in real-time. Built with Maven and designed for robust, authenticated Twitch integration with the 'fftbattleground' channel.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- Java 11 (OpenJDK)
- Spring Boot 2.7.18 framework (Web + WebSocket)
- Maven 3.9.4 for build management
- twitch4j library for Twitch API integration
- Spring Boot integrated logging
- Thymeleaf templating engine
- SockJS + STOMP for WebSocket communication

**Design Pattern:**
- Spring Boot application with dependency injection
- Component-based architecture using Spring annotations
- Event-driven chat handling using twitch4j's event system
- Configuration management through Spring Boot properties
- CommandLineRunner interface for application startup
- Graceful shutdown handling with @PreDestroy annotation

## Key Components

**Main Classes:**
- `TwitchChatReaderApplication.java` - Spring Boot main application class
- `TwitchChatReader.java` - Spring component implementing CommandLineRunner for chat client management
- `ChatEventHandler.java` - Spring component handling incoming chat events and WebSocket broadcasting
- `TwitchProperties.java` - Spring Boot configuration properties class for Twitch settings
- `ChatMessage.java` - Model class for chat message data
- `ChatMessageService.java` - Service managing the last 50 chat messages
- `WebSocketConfig.java` - WebSocket configuration for real-time communication
- `WebController.java` - Web controller serving the chat viewer interface
- `application.properties` - Spring Boot configuration file

**Features:**
- Real-time chat message display with timestamps (console + web)
- Modern web interface with Twitch-inspired design
- WebSocket-powered live message streaming
- Last 50 messages storage and display
- Auto-reconnection on connection loss
- Graceful shutdown with 'q' command
- Flexible configuration via environment variables or properties file
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing

## Data Flow

1. Spring Boot application starts and loads configuration from `application.properties` and environment variables
2. Creates OAuth2 credential (anonymous if no token provided)
3. Initializes Twitch client and registers event handlers
4. Connects to specified Twitch channel
5. Listens for chat events and displays formatted messages
6. Monitors connection health and auto-reconnects if needed
7. User can quit gracefully with 'q' command
