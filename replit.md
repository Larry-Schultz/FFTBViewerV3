# Twitch Chat Reader - Java Application

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT NOTES - READ FIRST! ⚠️

**FRONTEND BUILD PROCESS - ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS ORDER:**
1. Make frontend changes in `frontend/src/`
2. Build frontend: `npx webpack --mode production`
3. **CRITICAL**: Rebuild Java: `export JAVA_HOME=/nix/store/023zqb5jvvjhv5l1b0fzdaqxy8c7ilcl-adoptopenjdk-openj9-bin-11.0.11 && export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PWD/maven/bin:$PATH && mvn clean compile -q`
4. Restart server: Use workflow restart button

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Webpack builds to `src/main/resources/static/dist/`
- Server runs from `target/classes/static/dist/`
- Java build copies resources from src → target
- **Frontend changes will NOT work without Java rebuild!**

## Overview

A modern Spring Boot-powered Twitch chat reader application that monitors real-time chat messages from specific Twitch channels. Features both console output and a web interface with WebSocket support to display the last 50 chat messages in real-time. Built with Maven and designed for robust, authenticated Twitch integration with the 'fftbattleground' channel.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Key Lessons Learned

**Spring Boot Profile Configuration (July 19, 2025):**
- **@Profile on @Scheduled methods doesn't work reliably** - Spring doesn't properly respect @Profile annotations on individual @Scheduled methods within a service class
- **Solution**: Create separate @Configuration classes with @Profile("prod") that contain all scheduled tasks
- **Dependency Injection**: When services are profile-restricted, use @Autowired(required = false) and null checks in controllers
- **Workflow Configuration**: Always specify profile explicitly in deployment commands: --spring.profiles.active=dev

**Frontend Property Mapping Issues:**
- **Property Name Mismatches**: Frontend using song.lastPlayed when backend property is song.updatedAt causes sorting failures
- **Database Reality**: Only 1.3% of songs have Last Played data - this explains why sorting by Last Played shows few results
- **Frontend Debugging**: Always verify frontend TypeScript interfaces match backend entity properties exactly

**Development Workflow Optimization:**
- **Sync Jobs in Development**: Running playlist sync jobs during development startup causes unnecessary delays and confusion
- **Profile Separation**: Development should focus on UI/UX testing, not data synchronization
- **Manual Sync Available**: Keep sync services available for manual testing via API endpoints
- **Quick Startup**: Development mode should start servers in under 10 seconds without background operations

**Build Process Dependencies:**
- **Frontend → Backend Flow**: Always rebuild Java after frontend changes (webpack alone insufficient)
- **Resource Copying**: Spring Boot copies resources from src/main/resources → target/classes during compilation
- **Critical Path**: 1) Frontend changes, 2) Webpack build, 3) Java rebuild, 4) Server restart

**Error Handling Patterns:**
- **Null Safety**: Always implement null checks for optional dependencies
- **Profile-Aware Services**: Design services to gracefully handle missing dependencies in different environments
- **Logging Clarity**: Use environment-specific logging to distinguish between development and production behavior

- `TWITCH_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable or `twitch.access-token` in application.properties (for authentication)
- `TWITCH_USERNAME` environment variable or `twitch.username` in application.properties (for bot identification)

## Frontend Development Guide

**Making CSS/Styling Changes:**
1. Edit CSS files in `frontend/src/styles/main.css`
2. Build the frontend: `cd /home/runner/workspace && npx webpack --mode production`
3. **CRITICAL**: Rebuild Java application: `export JAVA_HOME=/nix/store/023zqb5jvvjhv5l1b0fzdaqxy8c7ilcl-adoptopenjdk-openj9-bin-11.0.11 && export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PWD/maven/bin:$PATH && mvn clean compile -q`
4. Restart the backend server: Use the "Server" workflow restart button or `restart_workflow` tool
5. **CRITICAL**: Ensure CSS paths in `src/main/resources/static/react/index.html` use absolute paths (e.g., `/dist/styles.css` not `../dist/styles.css`)

**Frontend Architecture:**
- TypeScript source: `frontend/src/`
- Built output: `src/main/resources/static/dist/`
- Served from: Java Spring Boot copies to `target/classes/static/dist/` during compilation
- Entry point: `src/main/resources/static/react/index.html`

**CRITICAL BUILD PROCESS:**
- Webpack builds frontend to `src/main/resources/static/dist/`
- Java compilation copies resources from `src/main/resources/` to `target/classes/`
- Server serves files from `target/classes/static/dist/`
- **ALWAYS rebuild Java after frontend changes** - webpack alone is not sufficient!

**Common Issues:**
- CSS not loading: Check paths in index.html are absolute (`/dist/`) not relative (`../dist/`)
- Changes not visible: Ensure webpack build completed AND Java rebuilt AND server restarted
- TypeScript errors: Run `npx webpack` to see compilation errors
- JavaScript errors persist: Check if Java rebuild copied updated bundle.js to target/classes

## Deployment Strategy

**Local Development:**
- Run using Spring Boot with `mvn spring-boot:run` command
- Web interface available at http://localhost:5000
- Configuration through `application.properties` file
- Logs output to console using Spring Boot logging
- WebSocket endpoint at /ws for real-time communication

**Environment Setup:**
- Java 11 installation required
- Maven 3.9.4 for dependency management
- No external database or web server needed

- **Improved song titles**: Song titles now display correctly (e.g., "'Splosion Man - Donuts, Go Nuts!" instead of encoded text)
- **Database refresh**: Cleared existing songs and repopulating with correctly parsed titles from URI field
- **Processing 32,732 songs**: Complete refresh in progress with new URI-based parsing method
- **DEPLOYMENT SCRIPTS CLEANUP**: Removed 10 redundant deployment scripts, kept only 3 essential ones
- **Simplified deployment**: Consolidated all functionality into `run`, `start.sh`, and `bin/run` scripts
- **Removed redundant files**: Cleaned up deployment documentation and kept only essential guides
- **SEPARATED BUILD AND RUN SCRIPTS**: Created dedicated `build.sh` for compilation and optimized runtime scripts
- **Build/Runtime separation**: Build script handles Java/Maven setup and compilation, runtime scripts focus only on JAR execution
- **Optimized for Replit**: Architecture now supports Replit's separate build and run phases for better deployment efficiency
- **Lightweight runtime**: Runtime scripts now have minimal Java detection and faster startup times
- **ENHANCED JAVA DETECTION**: Fixed deployment Java detection issues with improved Nix store scanning
- **Robust path discovery**: Using `find` instead of `ls` for reliable Java installation detection
- **Better version selection**: Implemented version sorting to select most recent Java installations
- **Comprehensive debugging**: Added detailed logging for deployment troubleshooting
- **DEPLOYMENT BUILD OPTIMIZATION**: Created multiple optimized build scripts to handle deployment timeouts
- **Hybrid build strategy**: `build.sh` uses fast Java detection with fallback to portable downloads
- **Self-contained builds**: Build script can download its own Java if environment detection fails
- **Timeout prevention**: Eliminated lengthy Java searches by using direct path detection and portable runtimes
- **DEPLOYMENT TIMEOUT SOLUTION**: Resolved deployment timeouts with hybrid Java detection and portable JRE fallbacks
