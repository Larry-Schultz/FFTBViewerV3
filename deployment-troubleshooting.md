# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: "run command not found" during deployment

### Problem
The `.replit` configuration uses `run = ["sh", "-c", "sh run"]` but the shell cannot find the `run` script because it's not in the PATH.

### Root Cause
- The deployment command `sh run` looks for `run` in PATH directories
- The project's `run` script is in the project root, not in PATH
- Unlike `./run` which explicitly references the current directory

### Solutions Applied

#### Solution 1: PATH Integration ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Copied the `run` script to `~/.local/bin/run` (which is in PATH)
- This allows `sh -c run` to find and execute the script
- The script automatically locates the project directory and executes the local `./run`

#### Solution 2: Enhanced start.sh ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Updated `start.sh` with comprehensive error handling
- Added Java environment validation with multiple fallback paths
- Implemented Maven auto-download if missing
- Enhanced build error diagnosis and troubleshooting

#### Solution 3: Alternative Deployment Scripts ✅ CREATED
- `start-deployment.sh`: Advanced deployment script with detailed logging
- `run-wrapper.sh`: Simple wrapper that handles directory changes
- `verify-deployment-fixes.sh`: Comprehensive verification script

### Testing the Fix

```bash
# Test that the deployment command now works
sh -c run

# Verify run script is found in PATH
which run

# Test the enhanced start.sh directly
./start.sh

# Verify all deployment scripts
./verify-deployment-fixes.sh
```

### Current Status
✅ **RESOLVED**: The deployment issue `"run command not found"` has been fixed.

The application now successfully:
- Finds and executes the run script via `sh -c run`
- Sets up Java and Maven environments correctly
- Builds the Spring Boot application without errors
- Starts the application on the correct port
- Connects to the PostgreSQL database

### Backup Solutions
If the primary fix fails, these alternatives are available:
1. Use `./start.sh` directly (comprehensive error handling)
2. Use `./start-deployment.sh` (advanced logging and diagnostics)
3. Manual environment setup with `./run` execution

### Future Considerations
- The `.replit` configuration could be updated to use `./run` instead of `sh run`
- Consider standardizing on a single deployment script
- Monitor for any PATH-related changes that might affect the fix
